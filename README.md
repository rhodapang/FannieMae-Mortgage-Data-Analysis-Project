# FannieMae-Mortgage-Data-Analysis-Project
 
The purpose of this data science project is to:
➤ Built up a database by PostgreSQL for Fannie Mae mortgage dataset, explore numerical variables and categorical variables in dataset, understand their correlation between those variables
➤ Analyzed Single Monthly Mortality (SMM) and CPR for the loans: calculated them for a specific period mortgage loan, explore their relationship against Time in different groups and against Economic index (Unemployment Rate, HPI, FHLMC)
➤ Analyzed roll rate analysis depending on the delinquency status of each loan
